# VVVV-SummerSeason2023

Patches for the [VVVV Intermediates â€“ Summer 2023](https://thenodeinstitute.org/vvvv-intermediates-summer-2023/) season.

### 1. Creating an App from Scratch.
May 4th 2023  
You'll learn everything about the newly introduced ImGui library for the quickest way yet to build UIs for your projects. 
Using ImGui in connection with the also new "Channels" node-set will speed up your patching massively if done right. 
You'll learn from no other than `untone`, core devvvv, who did most of the heavy lifting of getting ImGui to work in vvvv nicely.
