# VVVV-SummerSeason2023

Patches for the [VVVV Intermediates â€“ Summer 2023](https://thenodeinstitute.org/vvvv-intermediates-summer-2023/) season.

### 1. Creating an App from Scratch.
May 4th 2023  
You'll learn everything about the newly introduced [ImGui](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/vvvv-gamma-5.0-release/#effortless-creation-of-user-interfaces) library for the quickest way yet to build UIs for your projects. 
Using ImGui in connection with the also new [Channels](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/vvvv-gamma-5.0-release/#quick-data-binding-using-channels) node-set will speed up your patching massively if done right. 
You'll learn from no other than `untone`, core devvvv, who did most of the heavy lifting of getting ImGui to work in vvvv nicely.
